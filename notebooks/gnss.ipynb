    "Assume the receiver clock bias is $t_{b_r}$ and the signal receiving time is $t_r$ and sending time is $t_s$, the pseudo range $ \\rho = c * (t_r + t_{b_r} - t_s)$. If $t_{b_r}$ is positive, this means that the receiver's clock is slower than it should be. The receiver perceives the signal arrives earlier than it actually is. So the pseudo range is smaller than it actually is. This is why we will have a positive correction value as $c * t_{b_r}$ as in $ \\rho = c * (t_r - t_s) + c * t_{b_r}$.\n",

The P-code or Precision Code is modulated at 10.23MHz. The L2 carrier has just one code modulated upon it. The L2 P-code is modulated at 10.23 MHz. C/A code is at a lower resolution ( 1 / 1.023Mhz = 977.5ns -> 293 meters) while P code is at a higher resolution (97.75ns -> 29.3 meter). However, this doesn't mean the pseudo range will have such large error. In reality, signal processing techniques can resolve fractions of a chip â€” even down to a few meters or less.
